      <Description><![CDATA[I ripped code from two projects, fused and improved them. The sorting idea was ripped from Paul Tingey, his PropertySorter class. Globalization was ripped from Globalized Property Grid by Gerd Klevesaat. He, however, used inheritance from GlobalizationObject, which makes the mechanism not so flexible. ]]></Description>

When closed, the PropertyGrid would be updated to reflect the selected value.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[When you set the Stretch property of a ToolStrip control to true, the control fills its container from end to end, and resizes when its container resizes. In this configuration, you may find it useful to stretch an item in the control, such as a ToolStripTextBox, to fill the available space and to resize when the control resizes. This stretching is useful, for example, if you want to achieve appearance and behavior similar to the address bar in Microsoft® Internet Explorer.]]></Description>
