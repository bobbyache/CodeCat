      <Description><![CDATA[I ripped code from two projects, fused and improved them. The sorting idea was ripped from Paul Tingey, his PropertySorter class. Globalization was ripped from Globalized Property Grid by Gerd Klevesaat. He, however, used inheritance from GlobalizationObject, which makes the mechanism not so flexible. ]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[While working on a project, I was asked to include a PropertyGrid control to a screen to allow for configuration of equipment and to do validation. As I had not used a PropertyGrid control before, I started searching for examples, and was dismayed at what I was finding, or in the case of validation, not finding.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[I have a List<> (my custom class). I want to display a specific item in this list in a box on the PropertyGrid control. At the end of the box I would like the [...] button. When clicked, it would open up a form which, among other things, would allow them to pick one of the items from the List. When closed, the PropertyGrid would be updated to reflect the selected value.]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[MICROSOFT MSDN - (Excellent starter resource) - The .NET Framework PropertyGrid control is core to the property browser that is in Visual Studio .NET. The PropertyGrid control displays properties for any object or type, and it retrieves the item's properties, primarily using reflection. (Reflection is a technology that provides type information at run time.)]]></Description>

      <Description><![CDATA[This question seems to come up repeatedly: I have some internal (package-private in Java) code. How do I unit test it? The short answer is: you unit test it as you unit test all other code: through the public API of the System Under Test (SUT).

      <Description><![CDATA[When you set the Stretch property of a ToolStrip control to true, the control fills its container from end to end, and resizes when its container resizes. In this configuration, you may find it useful to stretch an item in the control, such as a ToolStripTextBox, to fill the available space and to resize when the control resizes. This stretching is useful, for example, if you want to achieve appearance and behavior similar to the address bar in Microsoft® Internet Explorer.]]></Description>
